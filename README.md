# CNN Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories:

* 🐻 Bears
* 🐼 Pandas

CNNs are specialized deep learning models designed to process grid-like data such as images. They automatically extract spatial features using convolution operations and are widely used in:

- Image Classification

- Object Detection

- Face Recognition

- Medical Imaging

- Segmentation Tasks


## Dataset Information

Total Images: 1200

Image Size: 32 × 32

Classes: 2 (Balanced Dataset)

Images per Class:
- Bears – 600
- Pandas – 600


## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
